(COPY AND MODIFY THIS FILE - do not edit the original)

Stores configuration values for the web document EVTL pipeline.
Source: arXiv abstract page for "Agents of Chaos" (2602.20021)

Purpose

  Store configuration values.

Analytical Questions

- What web page URL should be used as the data source?
- Where should raw and processed data be stored?

Notes

Following our process, do NOT edit this _case file directly,
keep it as a working example.

In your custom project,copy this _case.py file and
append with _yourname.py instead.

Then edit your copied Python file to change:
- PAGE_URL (source of the HTML web page document),
- customize your output file name.
